## Assessment Questions

### Learning Objective 1 - What is Encryption

#### Question 1: What is the difference between asymmetric and symmetric encryption?

**ANSWER: Symmetrical encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. While asymmetric uses 2 different keys for encryption a private key uses to encrypt the data and a public that can decrypt it.**

#### Question 2: Which of these isn't a well known encryption cipher
*  A: Bacon
*  B: Vigenere
*  C: Minimalist
*  D: Affine

**ANSWER: The answer is C, The Minimalist Cipher does not exist **

### Learning Objective 2 - How do you use encryption

#### Question 1: When using PGP which key requires a password?

**ANSWER: The Private key requires a password**

#### Question 2: If you wanted to make a secure hash of a file which of these algorithms would you use?
*  A: SHA-256
*  B: WinZip
*  C: SHA-1
*  D: Notepad

**ANSWER: The answer is A, You should use SHA-256 because SHA-1 is broken and collisions can be made**

### Learning Objective 3 - Cryptoanalysis

#### Question 1: Which 2 of these are technqiues that can be used to crack encryption with the ideal circumstances?
*  A: Plaintexting
*  B: Frequency Analysis
*  C: Defanging
*  D: Bruteforcing

**ANSWER: The answer is B and D, Frequency analysis and bruteforcing are techniques that can be used to break encryption the others are not.**

#### Question 2: What should you avoid doing when implementing encryption?
*  A: Create you own encryption algorithm
*  B: Test your algorithm in public
*  C: Read the instructional documentation
*  D: Tell others what type of encryption you are using

**ANSWER: The answer is A, you should avoid implementing you own encryption algorithms and favor using a test and proven algorithm.**
